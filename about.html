<h2>What is GSDB anyway ?</h2>
<p>
GSDB is a graphical browser for Shogi games.  These games originate from professional and amateur tournaments all over the world. (mostly Japan and Europe)<p>
For more information on shogi I can warmly recommend that you catch the next wave and surf to <A HREF="http://www.halcyon.com/stouten/shogi.html">Pieter Stouten's shogi pages</a>.<p>
Most people who start playing <A HREF="http://www.halcyon.com/stouten/shogi.html">Shogi</a> say it's a great game.  To become a good shogi-player however, you need to know how professional shogi-players are playing.  Well, this database allows you to see how other people have played the game in competition.  Also you can review some opening theory.
