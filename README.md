What is GSDB anyway ?
---------------------

GSDB is a graphical browser for Shogi games. These games originate from professional and amateur tournaments all over the world. (mostly Japan and Europe)

For more information on shogi I can warmly recommend that you catch the next wave and surf to [Shogi Harbour's videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRnXG7CkKfEN6IINKcO_uBg).

Most people who start playing [Shogi](http://www.halcyon.com/stouten/shogi.html) say it's a great game. To become a good shogi-player however, you need to know how professional shogi-players are playing. Well, this database allows you to see how other people have played the game in competition. Also you can review some opening theory.

In remembrance of George Hodges (1934-2010)

George Hodges first learned shogi from Trevor Leggett’s book, Shogi: Japan’s Game of Strategy (1966). He felt Westerners would love shogi, so arranged the creation of westernized shogi sets, and imported traditional shogi sets from Japan. With the help of Glyndon Townhill, he devised the common English shogi game notation still used globally.

In 1975 George Hodges founded The Shogi Association (TSA), and in January of 1976, he presented the world Shogi, a magazine. In Hodges’ own words, it was “the first magazine printed in English and devoted entirely to the great chess game of Japan.” He put together 70 professional quality issues, filled with news and translated professional articles from Japan, though the subscriber base never rose much above 150.

Not only did George run the magazine, but he also financed tournaments and The Shogi Association. He lent a great deal of money without receiving anything but a small financial return. Hodges’ efforts can only be described as philanthropic.

George wrote in issue 70 at the end of 1987, “I think I have shown the way in which shogi should be propagated. It is now up to others to take up this mammoth task if they have the will so to do.”

I dedicate this set of shogi articles to George Hodges. He was a driving force behind shogi popularization in the English speaking world for an entire generation. George’s efforts with The Shogi Association and Shogi magazine brought shogi news, strategy, history, and variants to those not privileged enough to understand Japanese in a pre-internet world. In the few correspondences that we had, I found him friendly, helpful, and dedicated to spreading knowledge about this beautiful game.

Thank you George Hodges (1934-2010).
