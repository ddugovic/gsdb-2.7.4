What is GSDB anyway ?
---------------------

GSDB is a graphical browser for Shogi games. These games originate from professional and amateur tournaments all over the world. (mostly Japan and Europe)

For more information on shogi I can warmly recommend that you catch the next wave and surf to [Shogi Harbour's videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRnXG7CkKfEN6IINKcO_uBg).

Most people who start playing [Shogi](http://www.halcyon.com/stouten/shogi.html) say it's a great game. To become a good shogi-player however, you need to know how professional shogi-players are playing. Well, this database allows you to see how other people have played the game in competition. Also you can review some opening theory.
